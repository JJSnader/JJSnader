College student and fulltime software developer, mostly developing in .NET and SQL currently.
Also have interest in Python and TypeScript.
Java is dead. I will not code Java if I can help it.
I will, however, drink lots of java. This is a prerequisite for a developer.

I don't think anyone will actually read this, I'm just doing it to get the notification off my dashboard.
